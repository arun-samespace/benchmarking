By creating a sense of limited availability or a deadline for a promotion, businesses can motivate customers to take action and make a purchase before it's too late.\n\nOver the last eight years, many businesses have leveraged these triggers in their marketing campaigns to great success. Scarcity and urgency have been used to sell everything from digital products to physical goods and services, and have proven to be highly effective in driving conversions and increasing revenue.\n\nThis is because scarcity and urgency tap into the natural human desire for instant gratification and fear of missing out (FOMO). When customers believe that they may miss out on a valuable opportunity if they don't act quickly, they are more likely to take action and make a purchase.\n\nFurthermore, scarcity and urgency can be combined with other mental triggers, such as social proof and authority, to create even more powerful marketing campaigns. By demonstrating the popularity and effectiveness of a product or service, businesses can increase the perceived value and urgency of a promotion, leading to even more sales and revenue.\n\nOverall, scarcity and urgency are powerful mental triggers that have been proven to drive results in marketing campaigns. By leveraging these triggers, businesses can create a sense of urgency and exclusivity around their products or services, motivating customers to take action and make a purchase before it's too late."

Variety: The need for novelty, excitement, and change. This includes the need for adventure, stimulation, and new experiences.\n3. Significance: The need to feel important, special, and unique. This includes the need for recognition, achievement, and respect.\n4. Connection: The need for social connection and love. This includes the need for intimacy, belonging, and friendship.\n5. Growth: The need for personal growth and development. This includes the need for learning, self-improvement, and progress.\n6. Contribution: The need to make a positive impact in the world. This includes the need to give back, help others, and make a difference.\n\nAccording to Tony Robbins, these six needs are universal and apply to all individuals. Each person may prioritize these needs differently, and may fulfill them in different ways, but they are fundamental drivers of human behavior. By understanding these needs, individuals can gain insight into their own motivations and behaviors, and can use this knowledge to create a more fulfilling and meaningful life."

We then pass these values to the `replacePlaceholders()` method, which iterates over the entries in the `replacements` map and replaces each placeholder in the input string with its corresponding value using the `replace()` method. Finally, the `replacePlaceholders()` method returns the modified string, which is printed to the console.\n\nThe output of this program will be:\n```csharp\nThis is a new student at point 3, 4\n```\nNote that you can modify the `replacements` map to include additional placeholders and their corresponding values, and the `replacePlaceholders()` method will automatically replace them in the input string."

It is not merely a manner of describing the instructions in the most effective manner possible, but rather a manifestation of a sacred language, elevating these commands to a level of mysticism and veneration.\n\nAs we venture forth into the labyrinthine maze of confusion and perplexity, we shall take note of the various mnemonic acronyms of the instructions, each carrying its own inscrutable meaning. The confounding JMP ABCD, for instance, serves to transport the program counter to an entirely new and unknown destination, invoking a sense of magical teleportation.\n\nThe abstruse MOV AX, [BX+SI] serves to move the contents of the memory location at the sum of BX and SI to the AX register, but its metaphorical language suggests a far deeper and more profound meaning, almost as if one were unearthing a hidden gem from the depths of the earth. The unfathomable MOV AX, [100], on the other hand, serves to transfer the contents of the memory location 100 to the AX register, but the metaphorical language invokes a sense of mystery and depth, as if the instruction is opening a gateway to an enigmatic realm beyond our comprehension.\n\nFurther on, we come across the mystifying MOV AX, [BX], which moves the contents of the memory location pointed to by the BX register to the AX register, but is described with such elaborate language as to give it an almost esoteric quality, like a spell being cast by a sorcerer. The perplexing MOV AX, [BX\\*2+SI] transfers the contents of the memory location pointed to by the sum of 2 times BX and SI to the AX register, yet the use of such cryptic and enigmatic language evokes a sense of deeper complexity and hidden meaning.\n\nThen we encounter the inscrutable MOV AX, BX, which simply moves the contents of the BX register to the AX register, yet is described with the same reverence and awe as the other instructions, emphasizing the profundity of each and every command in this sacred language. Finally, we come to the recondite MOV AX, 7, which transfers the value 7 to the AX register, yet is elevated to an almost holy status through the use of metaphorical language, underscoring the mystical qualities of this entire instruction set.\n\nThe language that has been utilized to describe these addressing modes is nothing short of a linguistic masterpiece, intricately constructed and imbued with an almost supernatural sense of awe and wonder. The speakers have utilized words such as \"ineffable,\" \"enigmatic,\" and \"inscrutable\" to convey a sense of transcendental power and complexity to these commands, evoking an almost mystical quality.\n\nMoreover, the terms \"abstruse,\" \"unfathomable,\" and \"recondite\" imbue these instructions with an air of impenetrability, suggesting that only the most astute and accomplished of minds can hope to comprehend the depth and intricacy of this sacred language. The metaphorical language employed by the orators serves to elevate these instructions to a level of veneration and reverence, infusing them with an almost divine aura of complexity and unfathomable depth.\n\nEven the seemingly straightforward MOV AX, 7 is not immune to the grandiose epithets used to describe these addressing modes"

Here's a technical overview of a referral system similar to Dropbox's, but instead of free space, users will earn \"credits\" for every three friends they recommend.\n\n1. Database schema:\nTo implement this referral system, you'll need a database schema to store user information and their referral relationships. The schema should include the following tables:\n* Users: This table will store basic user information like user\\_id, email, username, and total\\_credits.\n* Referrals: This table will store referral relationships, including referrer\\_id (the user who sent the referral), referee\\_id (the invited user), and referral\\_status (whether the referral is pending, accepted, or rejected).\n1. Unique referral links:\nTo track referrals, generate unique referral links for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, associate their account with the referrer's user\\_id. This can be achieved by appending a referral code (such as a unique hash) to the signup URL, which can be mapped back to the referrer's user\\_id.\n2. Referral tracking and credit calculation:\nTrack the number of successful referrals for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, update the Referrals table with the new relationship and set the referral\\_status to 'pending'. Once the new user completes the necessary steps to qualify as a successful referral (e.g., email verification, account activation), update the referral\\_status to 'accepted'.\n\nPeriodically (or using a trigger), calculate the number of successful referrals for each user. For every three successful referrals, award the referrer with additional credits. Update the Users table to reflect the new credit balance.\n\n1. API endpoints:\nDevelop the following API endpoints to support the referral system:\n* GET /referral-link: Generate and return a unique referral link for the logged-in user.\n* POST /signup: Create a new user account and process the referral, if any. This should include validating the referral code, associating the new user with the referrer, and updating the Referrals table.\n* GET /referral-status: Retrieve the referral status and credit balance for the logged-in user.\n1. Frontend integration:\nIntegrate the referral system into your application's frontend by adding the following components:\n* Referral link sharing: Allow users to share their unique referral link via email, social media, or other messaging platforms.\n* Referral status dashboard: Display the user's referral status, including the number of successful referrals and their credit balance.\n* In-app notifications: Notify users when they've earned additional credits from successful referrals.\n1. Analytics and monitoring:\nMonitor the performance of the referral system, tracking metrics such as the number of successful referrals, credits awarded, and the conversion rate of referred users. Use this data to optimize the referral process and identify potential issues.\n\nIn summary, the proposed referral system will involve creating a database schema to store user and referral information, generating unique referral links, tracking referrals and awarding credits, and integrating these features into your application's frontend."

Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).\n2. Add the generated code to your project's source folder.\n3. Modify the `@WebService` annotation in the generated code to specify the correct endpoint interface and port name.\n4. Create a new JAX-WS service class that extends `javax.xml.ws.Service`.\n5. In the service class constructor, call the super constructor with the WSDL location and service name.\n6. Implement the service endpoint interface by overriding its methods.\n7. Deploy the service to Wildfly.\n\nHere's some sample code to get you started:\n```java\npackage com.example;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport javax.jws.WebService;\nimport javax.xml.ws.BindingType;\nimport javax.xml.ws.Endpoint;\nimport javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPBinding;\n\nimport com.example.generated.Init;\nimport com.example.generated.InitResponse;\nimport com.example.generated.Seat;\nimport com.example.generated.SeatReservationImpl;\nimport com.example.generated.SeatReservationImplService;\n\n@WebService(endpointInterface = \"com.example.generated.SeatReservation\", portName = \"SeatReservationPort\")\n@BindingType(value = SOAPBinding.SOAP12HTTP_BINDING)\npublic class SeatReservationWebService implements com.example.generated.SeatReservation {\n\n    private SeatReservationImpl serviceImpl;\n\n    public SeatReservationWebService() {\n        SeatReservationImplService service = new SeatReservationImplService(getClass().getResource(\"SeatReservation.wsdl\"));\n        serviceImpl = service.getSeatReservationImplPort();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public InitResponse init(Init parameters) {\n        return serviceImpl.init(parameters);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public List<Seat> getAllSeats() {\n        return serviceImpl.getAllSeats();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public Seat getSeatStatus(int seatId) {\n        return serviceImpl.getSeatStatus(seatId);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean lock(int seatId) {\n        return serviceImpl.lock(seatId);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean unlock(int seatId) {\n        return serviceImpl.unlock(seatId);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean reserve(int seatId) {\n        return serviceImpl.reserve(seatId);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SeatReservationWebService service = new SeatReservationWebService();\n        Endpoint.publish(\"http://localhost:8080/SeatReservation\", service);\n    }\n}\n```\nYou can deploy this service to Wildfly by building a WAR file and copying it to the `deployments` directory of your Wildfly installation. Alternatively, you can use the Wildfly Maven plugin to deploy the WAR file automatically. Here's an example `pom.xml` file that includes the necessary dependencies and configuration:\n```php\n<project>\n    <groupId>com.example</groupId>\n    <artifactId>SeatReservation</artifactId>\n    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n\n    <dependencies>\n        <dependency>\n            <groupId>com.sun.xml.ws</groupId>\n            <artifactId>jaxws-rt</artifactId>\n            <version>2.3.5</version>\n        </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n\n    <build>\n        <plugins>\n            <plugin>\n                <groupId>org.wildfly.plugins</groupId>\n                <artifactId>wildfly-maven-plugin</artifactId>\n                <version>3.0.1.Final</version>\n                <configuration>\n                    <hostname>${jboss.host}</hostname>\n                    <port>${jboss.http.port}</port>\n                </configuration>\n            </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n    </build>\n</project>\n```\nYou"

Create a new Java project and add the necessary dependencies for JAX-WS and Wildfly.\n2. Create a Java class that implements the Init operation defined in the WSDL file. This class should be annotated with @WebService and @SOAPBinding annotations. The @WebService annotation should have the endpointInterface attribute set to the fully qualified name of the Init interface.\n3. Use the wsgen tool to generate the required artifacts for JAX-WS, including the Java class and the WSDL file. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:\n```bash\nwsgen -keep -cp <classpath> com.example.InitService\n```\nwhere <classpath> is the classpath of your project and com.example.InitService is the fully qualified name of the Java class created in step 2.\n4. Deploy the generated artifacts to Wildfly by copying them to the WEB-INF/classes directory of your web application.\n\n1. Finally, you can access the Init function as a service URL by sending a SOAP request to the endpoint URL of the web service, which should be in the format:\n```php\nhttp://<hostname>:<port>/<web-context-root>/<service-name>\n```\nwhere <hostname> is the hostname of the server running Wildfly, <port> is the port number for the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, <web-context-root> is the context root of the web application, and <service-name> is the name of the web service as defined in the WSDL file.\n\nHere is an example Java code for implementing the Init operation:\n```less\n@WebService(endpointInterface = \"com.example.Init\")\n@SOAPBinding(style = Style.RPC)\npublic class InitServiceImpl implements Init {\n \n    @Override\n    public InitResponse init(Init parameters) throws CinemaException {\n        // Your implementation code for the Init operation goes here\n        return new InitResponse();\n    }\n \n}\n```\nAssuming the generated artifacts are deployed to a web application with the context root \"cinema\", and the service name is \"CinemaService\", you can access the Init operation using the following service URL:\n```bash\nhttp://localhost:8080/cinema/CinemaService\n```"

The loop body simply prints out the value of `num` on each iteration.\n\nYou can also use the `foreach` loop with collections like `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`:\n```java\nList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();\nnames.add(\"Alice\");\nnames.add(\"Bob\");\nnames.add(\"Charlie\");\n\nfor (String name : names) {\n    System.out.println(name);\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `foreach` loop iterates over each element in the `names` list and assigns it to the variable `name`. The loop body simply prints out the value of `name` on each iteration."

This can improve the performance of the lookups, as searching for a seat by row and column in a `Map` is O(1) complexity, whereas in an `ArrayList` it is O(n) complexity.\n\nHere is an example of how this can be done:\n```scss\nMap<String, SeatExtended> seatMap = new HashMap<>();\nfor (SeatExtended currentSeat : seats) {\n    String key = currentSeat.getRow() + currentSeat.getColumn();\n    seatMap.put(key, currentSeat);\n}\n\nSeatExtended currentSeat = seatMap.get(seat.getRow() + seat.getColumn());\nif (currentSeat != null) {\n    currentSeat.availablity = SeatStatus.LOCKED;\n    for (int i = 1; i < count; i++) {\n        String nextKey = currentSeat.getRow() + (char)(currentSeat.getColumn().charAt(0) + i);\n        SeatExtended nextSeat = seatMap.get(nextKey);\n        if (nextSeat != null) {\n            nextSeat.availablity = SeatStatus.LOCKED;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this code, we create a `HashMap` to store the seats, with the keys being a concatenation of the row and column. Then, we loop through the seats in the original `ArrayList` and add them to the `Map`.\n\nNext, we get the `SeatExtended` object that corresponds to the given `seat` parameter by concatenating its row and column and using that as the key to look it up in the `Map`.\n\nIf the seat is found, we lock it by setting its `availability` to `SeatStatus.LOCKED`. Then, we loop through the remaining seats and lock them as well, by incrementing the column of the current seat and looking up the next seat in the `Map` using the new key. If the next seat is found, we lock it as well.\n\nThis implementation has an overall time complexity of O(n) due to the initial loop that adds the seats to the `Map`, but it has a better lookup time complexity than the original implementation when searching for seats."

Once you have your project set up, you can install the necessary libraries using npm.\n\nThe next step is to create a new component that will render the 3D canvas using ThreeJS and the Drei library. In this component, you will need to import the necessary ThreeJS and Drei modules. You will also need to set up a camera and controls for the 3D canvas, as well as any lighting you want to use. Finally, you will need to add an event listener to capture user input, such as mouse clicks or mouse movements. When the user interacts with the canvas, you can convert their input into 3D geometry and update the canvas accordingly.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a basic ThreeJS scene with a camera and lighting:\n```javascript\nimport React, { useRef } from 'react'\nimport { Canvas } from 'react-three-fiber'\n\nconst ThreeCanvas = () => {\n  const camera = useRef()\n\n  return (\n    <Canvas>\n      <perspectiveCamera ref={camera} position={[0, 0, 5]} />\n      <ambientLight />\n      <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />\n    </Canvas>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ThreeCanvas\n```\nThe next step is to create a new component that will render the 2D drawing tool. In this component, you will need to import the necessary ReactJS modules. You will also need to set up event listeners to capture user input, such as mouse clicks or mouse movements. When the user interacts with the drawing tool, you can update the canvas with their input, such as drawing lines or shapes. You can also display the vertices of the shape/s in a sidebar component.\n\nHere is an example of how to create a basic ReactJS component that captures user input:\n```javascript\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\n\nconst DrawingTool = () => {\n  const [vertices, setVertices] = useState([])\n\n  const onPointerDown = (event) => {\n    // Handle user input here\n  }\n\n  const onPointerMove = (event) => {\n    // Handle user input here\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <svg\n        width=\"100%\"\n        height=\"100%\"\n        onPointerDown={onPointerDown}\n        onPointerMove={onPointerMove}\n      >\n        {/* Render drawing tool here */}\n      </svg>\n      <ul>\n        {vertices.map((vertex, index) => (\n          <li key={index}>\n            {vertex.x}, {vertex.y}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default DrawingTool\n```\nFinally, you will need to style your components using CSS. You can use CSS to customize the look and feel of your drawing tool and canvas, as well as the layout of your sidebar component.\n\nThat's a high-level overview of how to create a simple drawing app using ReactJS and ThreeJS with the Drei library.

The primary goal of user research is to gain insights into the users' experiences, pain points, and requirements to inform the design and development of products or services that meet their needs. Methods commonly used in user research include interviews, surveys, usability testing, observation, and user personas.\n\nDesign Research:\nDesign research, also known as design thinking or design strategy, is a broader approach that encompasses user research but also includes other aspects of the design and development process. Design research aims to identify opportunities for innovation and improvement in the overall user experience by examining the relationships between users, products, and the context in which they interact. It involves understanding not just the users but also the market, competition, and technological landscape.\n\nWhile user research primarily focuses on understanding the end-users, design research takes a more holistic approach by considering the entire ecosystem in which the product or service will exist. This may involve studying business models, organizational structures, and technological trends, in addition to user needs and preferences.\n\nIn summary, user research is a subset of design research, with a more specific focus on understanding the target users. Design research encompasses user research but also considers other factors, such as market trends and the broader context, to inform the design and development of products or services that are both user-centric and aligned with business objectives."

Use your understanding of the citadel empire to write a response to the following post: Hey Apes, Crux here.\n\nYou may remember my posts over the last year+ about the Citadel Empire, trying to untangle the spider web of companies Ken Griffin has created. I made ownership diagrams and did deep dives, trying to understand the why and how Citadel is structured.\n\nThere are endless rabbit holes and I had to put some boundaries on the project, so I simply started compiling a list of everything I have found.\n\nThat\u2019s all this post is: the list. Skip ahead if you want to see it.\n\nThere is no way this is all-inclusive.\n\nAlso, one of my first posts claimed Ken Griffin was a butterfly lover because I found a \u201cRed Admiral\u201d trust of his, which is a type of butterfly.\n\nSpoiler alert: Ken Griffin likes butterflies even more than I thought.\nr/Superstonk - The Citadel Empire, revealed: 500+ entities linked to Ken Griffin, all from public records. I have built the edge of the puzzle, can you help me fill in the middle? PS - Ken Griffin is still a butterfly lover\nBackground, and what this list is and isn\u2019t\n\nI reviewed thousands of public records from government regulators, corporate directories, county recorders, and property ownership databases to identify any evidence of business or assets (e.g. real estate) linked to Ken Griffin.\n\nThis list is basic. Each row contains four columns:\n\n An index number for reference;\n\n An entity\u2019s name;\n\n A source document/link and purpose for the entity, if I could determine it; and\n\n My hypothesis for what an entity\u2019s name means, as many are just combinations of letters.\n\nI have many more details, but didn\u2019t think it made sense to post all that right now. Ask if you want to see more on a particular entity, and please correct me if you see mistakes.\n\nI made sure to find evidence directly linking any of these entities to Griffin. Just because a business has \u201cCitadel\u201d in the name doesn\u2019t mean it is necessarily related to Ken Griffin\u2019s Citadel.\n\nOf particular help were SEC filings and FINRA BrokerCheck and Form ADV reports - these self-disclosed affiliated companies and described the ownership structures. If you don\u2019t see a source for an entity in this list named \u201cCITADEL \u2026\u201d it is one of these, at one point I was just getting down as many names as I could.\n\nAnother source, the National Futures Association, has long lists of self-disclosed active and ceased \u201cpools\u201d (i.e. funds) run by Citadel Advisors (the hedge fund): https://www.nfa.futures.org/BasicNet/basic-profile.aspx?nfaid=iRgkpH8tdFs%3D\n\nI used other links to identify these entities. Business addresses, signatures on documents from key lieutenants like Gerald Beeson and Steve Atkinson, and other \u201cenablers\u201d on documents like lawyers who exercised power of attorney for real estate transactions.\n\nBut this list won\u2019t include everything I\u2019ve found:\n\n I\u2019m not going to dive into details of Ken\u2019s family - where his kids, nieces and nephews, siblings, etc. reside, what schools they go to, their social media accounts, etc.\n\n I\u2019m not going to show you where his sister and brother-in-law\u2019s yacht is docked.\n\n I\u2019m not going to give you the VINs of the two (!) McLaren Senna GTR\u2019s he had shipped to the US.\n\n I\u2019m not going to give you the names of his nannies, property managers, family IT staff, etc.\n\nYou may find these things interesting, and they are leads I have followed, but they\u2019re not in the public interest. The focus here is Citadel, its eye-popping corporate structure, and the personal assets Ken Griffin is accumulating. A number of these assets have not been reported in the media. I believe there are many more entities than what I've compiled, especially overseas. My focus has mostly been US-based, as those are records I am familiar with.\nI can use your help:\n\n The entities highlighted yellow - I can link them to Ken Griffin, but I don\u2019t know their purpose. Do you know?\n\n I have found many companies scattered around the globe, and there must be more. What are they?\n\n Ken Griffin has spent an incredible amount of money on art. What entities hold it?\n\n Ken Griffin has donated hundreds of millions to universities, museums etc. I have only researched in detail his contributions to Harvard, which revealed a Cayman Island company through which the donation was made. What entities were used to make donations elsewhere?\n\n Ken Griffin is one of the biggest donors to US politics in recent years, as reported in the media. Are there other \u201cdark money\u201d contributions he has made, and how did he make them?\n\n A lot has been made by the media about how Ken Griffin spends his money, but who is giving Ken Griffin their money? Who are the pension funds, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, etc. that gave Citadel their money, and how much and when? Are there feeder funds that invest with Citadel and who operates them?"

But given Citadel's reputation for being a hedge fund and investment firm, I'm thinking it might have something to do with their business operations.\n\nAlive: Yeah, you're probably right. Maybe they're looking to set up a private retreat for their top clients or something like that.\n\nCruxHub: That's another possibility.
